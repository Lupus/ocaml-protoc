(** Protobuf File/Message/Field options

This module represents "compiled" option set, which is high level
representation, as opposed to low-level representation in Pb_raw_option module.

For the following "raw" set of options:

{[
  option (google.api.http).custom.kind = "FETCH";
  option (google.api.http).custom.path = "/foo/bar/baz/{id}";
  option (google.api.http).additional_bindings = {
      get: "/foo/bar/baz/{id}"
  };
  option (google.api.http).additional_bindings = {
      post: "/foo/bar/baz/"
      body: "*"
  };
]}

The "compiled" representation will have only one option [(google.api.http)],
which is a message:

{[
  option (google.api.http) = {
      custom: {
          kind: "FETCH"
          path: "/foo/bar/baz/{id}"
      }
      additional_bindings: [
        {
            get: "/foo/bar/baz/{id}"
        },
        {
            post: "/foo/bar/baz/"
            body: "*"
        }
      ]
  };
]}

Option normalization is happening in [Pb_typing_validation.normalize_option],
destructured field assigments are normalized back to nested messages. See
[Pb_typing_validation.compile_option] to see the full process of option
compilation.
