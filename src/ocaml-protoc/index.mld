{1 Ocaml-protoc}

This library is two things in one:
- stubs for the runtime component (now in the "pbrt" package, see {!Pbrt})
- some internal compiler library, as {!Ocaml_protoc_compiler_lib}.

For most users, the normal workflow is to use the [ocaml-protoc] compiler
executable to generate code, and link the generated code with the [pbrt] library.
No runtime dependency on "ocaml-protoc" should be needed.
